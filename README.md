# RefData_LC
This repository already provides sample `.pcd` data and reference code that fully demonstrate the calibration and optimization workflow end-to-end. Provided assets mirror the structure and format of the full proprietary dataset, enabling reproduction and validation of the pipeline. The proprietary dataset used in experiments is not included due to confidentiality; however, the provided samples are sufficient for methodology verification, reproduction, and benchmarking.
A permanent archival snapshot of the repository and methodology diagram is available on Zenodo:
- Repository DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXXXX
- Methodology Diagram DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.YYYYYYYY
## Dataset Overview
A representative `.pcd` file and all required reference scripts are included. Preprocessing, calibration, and optimization workflows can be executed directly with the provided data. Hardware specifications, software versions, and preprocessing parameters are documented in the associated publication. Additional dataset segments may be requested if required for extended experimentation.
## Sample Images
Representative point cloud and measurement output images are located in `/figures/`. Complete experiment visuals and analysis are contained in the publication.
## Reproducibility
All provided content is sufficient to reproduce the reported workflow: sample data aligns with the full dataset format; software and hardware requirements are documented; the methodology diagram and codebase together enable pipeline recreation for verification.
## Methodology Diagram
A complete workflow diagram is included and may be used to replicate the pipeline. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.YYYYYYYY
## Data Availability
Representative `.pcd` files and scripts are present. Additional proprietary data may be granted upon request when justified and approved. Request portal: https://forms.gle/7GKQZj3UFonACS1w7
